    Implements logic for a TFTP server.
    The input to this object is a received UDP packet,
    the output is the packets to be written to the socket.

    This class MUST NOT know anything about the existing sockets
    its input and outputs are byte arrays ONLY.

    Store the output packets in a buffer (some list) in this class
    the function get_next_output_packet returns the first item in
    the packets to be sent.

    This class is also responsible for reading/writing files to the
    hard disk.

    Failing to comply with those requirements will invalidate
    your submission.

    Feel free to add more functions to this class as long as
    those functions don't interact with sockets nor inputs from
    user/sockets. For example, you can add functions that you
    think they are "private" only. Private functions in Python
    start with an "_", check the example below
